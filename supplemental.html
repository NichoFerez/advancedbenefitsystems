Hospital Indemnity Insurance</h1>
<p>
Hospital costs already cause enough stress</p>

<p>Hospital indemnity coverage shifts the focus to healing, not finances
When you're in the hospital or undergoing outpatient surgery, the last thing you need to worry about is how much it will cost to get better. Even when you have health insurance, premiums don't cover everything. The average expense for a hospital stay ranges from $9,100 for a medical stay to $22,700 for a surgical stay.</p>
<p>
If you're admitted to the hospital for a covered accident or sickness, hospital indemnity insurance plans provide benefits that can help pay for hospitalÂ expenses that aren't covered by your health insurance, such as costs related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outpatient surgery</li>
<li>Inpatient services</li>
<li>Diagnostic tests</li>
<li>Doctor appointments</li>
<li>Emergency room trips</li>
</ul>

<p>
With this added financial protection, you can dedicate energy toward getting well instead of worrying about bills. Hospital indemnity insurance helps minimize its effect on your finances. After customizing a policy with your preferred benefit amount, you can use your insurance to pay for day-to-day bills or out-of-pocket medical costs, such as deductibles, co-payments and other expenses.</p>
<p>
Annual wellness benefits are available to help promote a healthy lifestyle.
All policies include:</p>
<ul>

<li>Benefits payable directly to the policyholder (unless specified otherwise) that can be used for any purpose</li>

<li>Availability for you, your spouse and eligible dependent children</li>
<li>Clear benefit amounts so you know the exact amount that's payable for covered services</li>
</ul>
