Flexible Benefits Solution</h1>
<p>
To bring in top talent, employers need to offer health benefits programs that empower employees to save and prepare for future medical expenses. Our Flexible Benefits partner Ameriflex offers a variety of plan types that do just that.</p>
<h2>
Premium Only Plans</h2>

<p>Premium Only Plans (also known as cafeteria plans or POP) are popular in today's marketplace and are an integral part of many employer benefit programs. Our Flexible Benefits solution allows you to offer your access to Premium Only Plans at no cost to them or you!</p>

<h3>Healthcare Flexible Spending Account (FSA)</h3>
<p>
Help your client’s employees save money on out-of-pocket, routine medical expenses. An FSA allows employees to set aside pre-tax dollars from their paycheck for eligible healthcare expenses. Participation decreases their taxable income, and in turn, decreases your costly FICA tax burden.</p>


<h3>Health Savings Account (HSA)</h3>
<p>Designed to be used in conjunction with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), HSAs are quickly becoming the go-to employee benefit account. HSAs are triple tax-advantaged: employees will not pay taxes on contributions, nor will they pay taxes on interest earned or upon withdrawal for qualified expenses. As an employer, you’ll save on high insurance premiums by offering an HDHP.</p>

<h3>Dependent Care Account (DCA)</h3>
<p>A DCA is an extension of an FSA and is designed to pay for the daily care of an eligible child or adult dependent. Funds can be used for expenses such as daycare, before- and after-school programs, eldercare, pre-school, and more.</p>

<p>Compliance is too big of a burden to carry on your own. Our Flexible Benefits partner Ameriflex is here to help you navigate the ever-changing regulations associated with consumer-driven healthcare plans and COBRA, so that you can focus more of your time and energy on the important things. Their compliance services include plan document preparation, discrimination testing, and an ERISA Concierge program tailored to help you and your clients manage the complexities of ERISA.</p>
