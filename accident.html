Accident Insurance
</h1>
<p>
When an accident happens, the last thing you want to think about is how you’re going to pay the bills. Accident insurance helps you pay for the medical and out-of-pocket costs that you may have after an accidental injury. Based on your policy, this can include emergency treatment, hospital stays, medical exams and other expenses like transportation and lodging. 
</p>
<p>
Accident insurance policies can provide you with a lump sum paid directly to you that will help pay for a wide range of situations, including initial care, surgery, transportation and lodging, and follow-up care. Here’s how it works:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A set amount is payable based on the injury you suffer and the treatment you receive.</li>
<li>Benefits are payable directly to you (unless you specify otherwise) and can be used as you see fit.</li>
<li>Coverage is available for you, your spouse and eligible dependent children.</li>
<li>You do not need to answer medical questions or have a physical exam to get basic coverage.</li>
<li>Accident insurance covers injuries that happen on the job or off the job, unlike workers’ compensation, which only covers on-the-job injuries.
Benefit payments are not reduced by any other insurance you may have with other companies.</li>
<li>Costs, eligibility and waiting periods before benefits are disbursed vary, contact us today for more information!</li>
</ul>
