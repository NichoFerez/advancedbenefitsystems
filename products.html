Telemedicine Solution
</h1>
<p>
There’s a simple way to expand your benefits package and give your employees better access to medical care. Telemedicine can help you provide an easier form of doctor visits for your client’s employees — virtual care. This service is available at no direct cost to you or them for the first year following the enrollment. </p>
<p>While not intended to replace a primary care doctor, telemedicine provides employees 24/7 access to board-certified doctors, where it’s most convenient for them.  After registering, employees can have a virtual consult to diagnose non-emergency medical issues over the phone or through secure video on their computer, tablet or Mobile App. When a medical condition calls for a prescription, doctors can send an e-prescription straight to the patient’s local pharmacy of choice (restrictions apply). </p>

<p>Here are some of the common conditions that can be treated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allergies</li>
<li>Asthma</li>
<li>Bronchitis</li>
<li>Cold and flu</li>
<li>Ear infections</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Joint aches</li>
<li>Respiratory infections</li>
<li>Sinus infections</li>
<li>Skin infections</li>
<li>Urinary tract infections</li>
</ul>
<p>
Making telemedicine part of your overall benefits offering is an easy way for your employer clients to show employees They care about their access to medical care. It can also help decrease employee absenteeism and increase productivity — while helping lower health care costs for their business. </p>

Flexible Benefits Solution</h1>
<p>
To bring in top talent, employers need to offer health benefits programs that empower employees to save and prepare for future medical expenses. Our Flexible Benefits partner Ameriflex offers a variety of plan types that do just that.</p>
<h2>
Premium Only Plans</h2>

<p>Premium Only Plans (also known as cafeteria plans or POP) are popular in today's marketplace and are an integral part of many employer benefit programs. Our Flexible Benefits solution allows you to offer your access to Premium Only Plans at no cost to them or you!</p>

<h3>Healthcare Flexible Spending Account (FSA)</h3>
<p>
Help your client’s employees save money on out-of-pocket, routine medical expenses. An FSA allows employees to set aside pre-tax dollars from their paycheck for eligible healthcare expenses. Participation decreases their taxable income, and in turn, decreases your costly FICA tax burden.</p>


<h3>Health Savings Account (HSA)</h3>
<p>Designed to be used in conjunction with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), HSAs are quickly becoming the go-to employee benefit account. HSAs are triple tax-advantaged: employees will not pay taxes on contributions, nor will they pay taxes on interest earned or upon withdrawal for qualified expenses. As an employer, you’ll save on high insurance premiums by offering an HDHP.</p>

<h3>Dependent Care Account (DCA)</h3>
<p>A DCA is an extension of an FSA and is designed to pay for the daily care of an eligible child or adult dependent. Funds can be used for expenses such as daycare, before- and after-school programs, eldercare, pre-school, and more.</p>

<p>Compliance is too big of a burden to carry on your own. Our Flexible Benefits partner Ameriflex is here to help you navigate the ever-changing regulations associated with consumer-driven healthcare plans and COBRA, so that you can focus more of your time and energy on the important things. Their compliance services include plan document preparation, discrimination testing, and an ERISA Concierge program tailored to help you and your clients manage the complexities of ERISA.</p>
