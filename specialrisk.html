Cancer Insurance</h1>
<p>
Most of us don't expect to face a serious illness like cancer. However, statistics show 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women develop cancer in their lifetime.1 Some look to family history to determine risk, but that often doesn't tell the whole story. While heredity and environmental factors can play a role, inherited genetic factors impact only about 5-10% of all cancers.</p>
<p>
Fortunately, more people are surviving cancer thanks to early detection and more aggressive treatments. If you're diagnosed with cancer, you may find that your medical insurance doesn't cover everything. In addition to your day-to-day bills, you could incur costs for treatment and recovery, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deductibles and co-pays</li>
<li>Out-of-network treatment</li>
<li>Travel, lodging and meals during treatment</li>
<li>Child care</li>
<li>Home health services</li>
</ul>
<p>
The need to scale back on work or take a leave of absence during treatment and recovery only adds to the stress. That's where supplemental cancer insurance helps. It assists with protecting you from financial hardship in the face of mounting cancer expenses.</p>

<p>
If cancer affects your life, you should be able to focus on finding the best treatment and getting better – not on how you'll pay your bills.
Cancer insurance offers benefits to assist with out-of-pocket costs that may not be covered by your medical insurance, including expenses related to inpatient or outpatient treatment, surgery, travel and recovery care.
Equally important, some plans also cover an annual cancer screening test to promote prevention and early diagnosis. Optional riders may be available to provide even more financial protection during the initial diagnosis period and hospital stays.
Coverage options are available for you, your spouse and your eligible dependents.
</p>
<p>
Benefits are payable directly to you, unless you specify otherwise.
Benefits are payable regardless of any insurance you have with other companies.
