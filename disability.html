Disability Insurance
</h1>

<p>
Income protection in times of need
Maintain your livelihood and lifestyle with disability insurance
You have insurance for your house, car and health, but if you're like many Americans, you probably don't have insurance for the one thing that pays those bills: your income. If an accident or illness prevented you from working, could you still cover your everyday expenses?</p>
<p>Disability insurance makes this question easy to answer. It can help protect your way of life and maintain your lifestyle if a physician determines you're unable to work due to a covered accident or illness.
Many people forgo disability insurance because they don't think they'll ever need it. However, over 90% of disabilities are caused by common illness or conditions,1 such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pregnancy and childbirth</li>
<li>Back and joint disorders</li>
<li>Accidents and fractures</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Heart attacks and strokes</li>
</ul>

<p>When you're unable to earn an income because of an illness or accident, your paycheck stops, but expenses continue. When an accident or illness happens, the last thing you want to think about is how you're going to pay the bills. With short-term disability benefits, you may receive financial support for up to two years, so you can focus on what really matters: recovering and getting back to work.</p>
<p>Disability insurance offers disability benefits, as well as a variety of optional provisions to pay for psychiatric conditions, psychological conditions and hospital admission. You can choose the appropriate benefit amount to meet your needs. No matter which amount or policy you select, benefits are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Payable on a monthly basis directly to you (unless you specify otherwise), regardless of any insurance you may have with other companies</li>
<li>Able to be used to pay for whatever you like, including rent, house payments, car payments, utilities, credit card bills, travel expenses and more</li>
<li>Potentially available if you return to work part time
Able to be kept if you change jobs</li>
</ul>
